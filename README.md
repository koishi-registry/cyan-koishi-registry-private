# Koishi registry fetch app

For end-user, use our
**Partner registry**
https://kp.itzdrli.cc/

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you find an unexpected behaviour different with Koishi's [Official registry](https://registry.koishi.chat/),
> please open an issue.

## Install
Deno is required.
```shell
deno install
```

## Usage
```shell
$ cp .env.example .env
```
```shell
$ deno task start
Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080/
```

It takes time to synchronize for the first time.

You can configure configurations in main.ts.

Check http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/plugins,
should return currently found plugins.
(It's empty list for a while because no plugins found now, please sit and relax)

Check http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.json
should return a Koishi Registry like JSON of all found plugins.
(The `objects` may be an empty list, because no plugins found now, please sit and relax)

### API Endpoint
#### /api/status
```typescript
let returns: {
  "synchronized": boolean, // If synchronized with npm
  "updateAt": string, // UTC Date String
  features: Record<Feature, boolean> // Field Features
}
```
#### /api/plugins
```typescript
let returns: string[] // a list of package name of koishi plugins
```

## Todo
- [x] Refactor `NpmWatcher` to provide a more reliable change information.
- [x] Refactor `KoishiRegistry` cache structure to provide Quick Patch functionality.
- [ ] Support `show_deprecated`, `show_incompatible`, `recover_unpublished` params.
- [ ] Support all fields of official registry
  - [x] verified - defaults to same behaviour with `@koishijs/registry`. controlled by `analyzer/is-verified`
  - [x] insecure - a default cloud analyzer is configured, official insecure list and algorithm is private (for @koishijs orgs member, contact me on social for official implementation)
                   could control by bail event `analyze/is-insecure`
  - [ ] score    - npm search api is unreliable
  - [x] rating   - a custom rating algorithm is implemented, official rating algorithm is private (for @koishijs orgs member, contact me on social for official implementation)
  - [x] portable - detect `koishi.browser` from package meta
  - [ ] downloads - support custom implementation(implements `Analyzer`), original one removed due to the hard rate limiting of npm downloads api
